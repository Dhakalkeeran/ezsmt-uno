"=====================\n"
"* Solvers using CLP(FD) will return error if there are constraint variables \n"
"  that still have an infinite/unspecified domain (i.e., inf..sup) after all \n"
"  constraints have been asserted.\n"
"  Consider using cspvar/3 for all constraint variables.\n"
"  A ramification of this is that the clearbox mode (--cmodels-feedback) may\n"
"  not work.\n"

"SWI-Prolog\n"
"=====================\n"
"* clp(fd) returns an error if there are constraint variables whose upper bound\n"
"  is sup or whose lower bound is inf after all constraints have been asserted.\n"
"  For example:\n"
"    cspvar(x).\n"
"    required(x #>= 3).\n"
"  will cause an error. Note that its translation to SWI-Prolog is equivalent\n"
"  to:\n"
"    :- use_module(library(clpfd)).\n"
"    X #>= 3, labeling([],[X]).\n"
"  Consider using cspvar/3 for all constraint variables.\n"
"  A ramification of this is that the clearbox mode (--cmodels-feedback) may\n"
"  not work.\n"
